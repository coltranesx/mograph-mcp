# mograph-mcp controller + MCP server + headless simulator.
#
# The CEP panel needs a real After Effects host to connect over the socket, so it
# is not part of this image. What runs here is everything that is headless: the
# controller (WS + REST + UI), the stdio/HTTP MCP server, and the AE simulator
# used for AE-free validation. Point the panel (or a tunnel) at this container.
